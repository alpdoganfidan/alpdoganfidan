  <p>
I am Alp, I am 23 and live in Ankara. I am fresh graduate from Istanbul Technical University. I worked as a RPA Developer at Native Digital, and as a Business Analyst at Ibtech with 2.5 years of total business experience.

I want to build my career path in Data Science or Backend Engineering. For this aim, I continously developed different projects, and also I completed courses earlier during my education.

I keep learning. Currently, I am partipating for Datathons for Data Science, getting courses for Docker, Kubernetes, PorstreSQL, NoSQL (MongoDB).

I know Trendyol and I believe that I would enjoy being part of your team.
